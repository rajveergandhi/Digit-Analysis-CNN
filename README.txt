feedforward.py
	- Our own implementation of the feef-forward neural network.
cnn-complete-pictures.py
	- Our most successful program that is able to generate model that results in accuracy of ~92% on kaggle.
cnn-rotated-chars
	- Experimental method which in the end was not used for getting results at kaggle and where the model was
	trained on pictures of individual characters.
Train_Test_LR
	- Logistic regression implementation, used to predict labels for testing data.
Train_Validation_LR
	- Logistic regression implementation, used to predict labels for training data.
letter-extraction.py
	- Code that was used for extracting characters from the pictures and were subsequently used in cnn-rotated-chars.py.
